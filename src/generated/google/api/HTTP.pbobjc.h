/// `HttpRule` defines the mapping of an RPC method to one or more HTTP REST API
/// methods. The mapping determines what portions of the request message are
/// populated from the path, query parameters, or body of the HTTP request.  The
/// mapping is typically specified as an `google.api.http` annotation, see
/// "google/api/annotations.proto" for details.
///
/// The mapping consists of a mandatory field specifying a path template and an
/// optional `body` field specifying what data is represented in the HTTP request
/// body. The field name for the path indicates the HTTP method. Example:
///
/// ```
/// package google.storage.v2;
///
/// import "google/api/annotations.proto";
///
/// service Storage {
///   rpc CreateObject(CreateObjectRequest) returns (Object) {
///     option (google.api.http) {
///       post: "/v2/{bucket_name=buckets/*}/objects"
///       body: "object"
///     };
///   };
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Here `bucket_name` and `object` bind to fields of the request message
/// `CreateObjectRequest`.
///
/// The rules for mapping HTTP path, query parameters, and body fields
/// to the request message are as follows:
///
/// 1. The `body` field specifies either `*` or a field path, or is
///    omitted. If omitted, it assumes there is no HTTP body.
/// 2. Leaf fields (recursive expansion of nested messages in the
///    request) can be classified into three types:
///     (a) Matched in the URL template.
///     (b) Covered by body (if body is `*`, everything except (a) fields;
///         else everything under the body field)
///     (c) All other fields.
/// 3. URL query parameters found in the HTTP request are mapped to (c) fields.
/// 4. Any body sent with an HTTP request can contain only (b) fields.
///
/// The syntax of the path template is as follows:
///
///     Template = "/" Segments [ Verb ] ;
///     Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ;
///     Segment  = "*" | "**" | LITERAL | Variable ;
///     Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ] "}" ;
///     FieldPath = IDENT { "." IDENT } ;
///     Verb     = ":" LITERAL ;
///
/// `*` matches a single path component, `**` zero or more path components, and
/// `LITERAL` a constant.  A `Variable` can match an entire path as specified
/// again by a template; this nested template must not contain further variables.
/// If no template is given with a variable, it matches a single path component.
/// The notation `{var}` is henceforth equivalent to `{var=*}`.
///
/// Use CustomHttpPattern to specify any HTTP method that is not included in the
/// pattern field, such as HEAD, or "*" to leave the HTTP method unspecified for
/// a given URL path rule. The wild-card rule is useful for services that provide
/// content to Web (HTML) clients.
